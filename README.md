# TxtDb-Final
 Final for my COBOL class at State Tech

 ## What is it?
 This is a COBOL program I made using COBOLIDE, so all of the files I am drawing from are in the bin folder.

## How did I do?
I ended up getting a perfect score on my final assignment, and I am overall satisfied with how I performed on it, especially given the rough teaching style we had for such an old language.
